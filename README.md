# NXP Demo Experience

## Description

The NXP Demo Experience is an interface that enable the user to launch any NXP demonstration without command line. With this approach, by using the BSP Yocto support, the user is able to run the available demos using only a mouse connected to the board, or the touch screen support, if the display has it.
