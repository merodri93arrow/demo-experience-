=== Application Resolution

The NXP Demo Experience was designed to support HD resolution (1280x720). However, the i.MX 7ULP EVK only
supports 640x480 resolution. So, by default, when the user runs the application, it checks the resolution
and if it is less then HD, the Demo Launcher will be opened in 640x480.

=== Supported Devices

* {7ULP_LONG}
* {QXP_LONG}
* {MQ_LONG}
