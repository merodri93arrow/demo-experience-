== Introduction

This page describes all the demos supported by the {DEMO_LAUNCHER}[i.MX Demo Launcher] application.
The user can modify the `JSON` file to set the demos according to its requirements.

Project bitbucket page - https://bitbucket.sw.nxp.com/projects/IMXS/repos/imx-demo-launcher-demos-list/browse

Download - git clone https://bitbucket.sw.nxp.com/scm/imxs/imx-demo-launcher-demos-list.git

=== Application Resolution

The i.MX Demo Launcher was designed to support HD resolution (1280x720). However, the i.MX 7ULP EVK only
supports 640x480 resolution. So, by default, when the user runs the application, it checks the resolution
and if it is less then HD, the Demo Launcher will be opened in 640x480.

=== Supported Devices

* {7ULP_LONG}
* {QXP_LONG}
* {MQ_LONG}
