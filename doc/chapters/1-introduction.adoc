The {DEMO_EXPERIENCE_LINK}[{NAME}] is an interface that enable the user to
launch any NXP demonstration without the command line. With this approach,
the user is able to run the available demos using only a mouse connected to the
board, or the touch screen support if the display has it.

This documentation contains the process to build the application, how to run
the demo application, and an appendix that contains all the steps to setup the
https://www.qt.io/[Qt Creator] in order to develop and deploy the application
to the device. There is also some information on how to use cameras from Basler.

For a list of all demos that are included in the {NAME}, please see the
documentation included in that README.md located at 
{DEMO_LIST_LINK}[the demo list repository].

=== NXP Demo Experience Repositories

repository is needed to create the entire NXP Demo Experience. Major releases
have separated by branch (imx_X.Z.y) and minor releases are tagged.

application is what users see when they launch the launcher. This
repository also contains this documentation.

to build the NXP Demo Experience.
