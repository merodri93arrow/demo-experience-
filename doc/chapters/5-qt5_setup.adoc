== Qt5 Setup

Text extracted by from

=== Overview

Qt is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software that can be run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase, while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed. It is running in TV, Car, HMI, 3D Printer, almost covering all of the embedded areas. This blog introduces how to setup the development environment to build Qt application, deploy to the board, and run application on the Linux BSP.

*Hardware Requirement*

PC Host: x86_64 Ubuntu-16.04LTS

Target: i.MX8QXP EVK with HDMI Screen

Micro-SD card

Ethernet cable & USB cable for console & Power adapter

=== QT SDK

QT one ecosystem provide SDK to build powerful, connected and beautiful applications that run on any screen and across any platform. Here for embedded development, we need the following tools:

Qt Creator IDE
Qt5.8 source code
HOST build toolchain
TARGET build toolchain
Qt Creator is a cross-platform C++, JavaScript and QML integrated development environment which is part of the SDK for the Qt GUI Application development framework. It includes a visual debugger and an integrated GUI layout and forms designer. It can run on both Windows, MacOS and Linux, developer create a Qt application on PC HOST and debug the UI on HOST build with HOST toolchain firstly. When debug completed, developer could use TARGET toolchain to build the application, and deploy the binary to embedded system like i.MX8QXP linux.

The HOST toolchain would be downloaded with SDK, but the TARGET toolchain is downloaded by Yocto introduced below.

=== Install Qt SDK

Online or offline installer for Linux version can be found on: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2 For example, we download a online one here: http://download.qt.io/official_releases/online_installers/qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run

Grant the executable permission to this binary, and run it.

----
$ chmod +x qt-unified-linux-x86_64-4.1.0-online.run
$ ./qt-unified-linux-x86_64-4.1.0-online.run
----

If you do not have a QT account, just create one. Otherwise login with your account, then "Next".

After all the packages downloaded and installed, you can run the Qt Creator by:

----
$ <Qt install dir>/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator
----

You would be able to open the examples in the Qt5.x source code and quickly use the HOST toolchain to build and run a example on PC.

=== Setting up the Yocto BSP

First make sure that git is set up properly with the commands below.

----
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "Your Email"
$ git config --list
----

The i.MX Yocto Project BSP Release directory contains a sources directory, which contains the recipes used to build one
or more build directories, and a set of scripts used to set up the environment.

The following example shows how to download the i.MX Yocto Project Community BSP recipe layers. For this example, a
directory called imx-yocto-bsp is created for the project. Any name can be used instead of this.

----
$ mkdir imx-yocto-bsp
$ cd imx-yocto-bsp
repo init -u https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/imx-manifest
-b imx-linux-gatesgarth -m imx-5.10.9-1.0.0.xml
$ repo sync
----

=== Setup environment

The command below specifies the name of the build directory created by the imx-setup-release.sh script.

----
$ DISTRO=fsl-imx-xwayland MACHINE=<machine name> source  imx-setup-release.sh -b build-wayland
----

After the script runs, the working directory is the one just created by the script, specified with the -b option. A conf folder is
created containing the files bblayers.conf and local.conf.

You need to add some contents to local.conf which is in the ~/imx-yocto-bsp/build-wayland/conf/ for this example:

----
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES ?= "debug-tweaks ssh-server-openssh"
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "openssh-sftp openssh-sftp-server"
----

=== Build rootfs

----
$ bitbake imx-image-full
----

=== Build toolchain

Build the QT5 target toolchain, which would be used on the QTCreator to build and deploy the QT application:

----
$ bitbake meta-toolchain-qt5
----

=== Deploy SDcard image

Deploy the rootfs onto the board, and install the cross compile toolchain used by Qt Creator onto the host computer. The install script for the cross compile toolchain can be found under: ~/imx-yocto-bsp/build-wayland/tmp/deploy/sdk

You can change the target directory for sdk if you want.

You will find the board image under: ~/imx-yocto-bsp/build-wayland/tmp/deploy/images/<board name>/. Flash the imx-image-full-imx8mpevk.wic.bz2 file onto the board.

=== Qt Creator configure

[NOTE%autofit]
====
The following steps contain various code snippets. Be aware that these code snippets may vary depending on your local setup and the version used.
====

Launch Qt Creator, create one project or use the example project and open it. In this example, I extracted the SDK to ~/opt, not the default.

=== Configure the cross toolchain

Open the "Build & Run" settings from [Menu] -> [Tools] -> [Options...].

1) Add target Qt5 qmake (deploy before under ~/opt/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/qt5) in the tab of "Qt versions":

image::qtversion.png[pdfwidth=100%]
image::g++.png[pdfwidth=100%]

2) Add cross compile g++/gcc toolchain:

----
GCC: ~/opt/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-poky-linux/aarch64-poky-linux-gcc
G++: ~/opt/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-poky-linux/aarch64-poky-linux-g++
----

image::qtcompilegcc.png[pdfwidth=100%]

3) Add gdb host tool:

----
 ~opt/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-poky-linux/aarch64-poky-linux-gdb
----

image::debugger.png[pdfwidth=100%]

4) Add Target Kits under the "Kits" Tab:

Select the correct Compiler/Debugger/Qt version created above. And make sure the "Qt mkspec" is set to linux-arm-gnueabi-g++. In this example is ~/opt/sysroots/aarch64-poky-linux/usr/lib/qt5/mkspecs/linux-arm-gnueabi-g++.

image::kits.png[pdfwidth=100%]

=== Qt mkspec

Update the mksepc file: ~/opt/sysroots/aarch64-poky-linux/usr/lib/qt5/mkspecs/linux-arm-gnueabi-g++/qmake.conf for the toolchain name (aarch64-poky-linux-), the --sysroot for linker.

=== Configure the remote device

Add one "Generic Linux" device for i.MX8QXP EVK board. Input the correct IP address, SSH port and username. Click the "Test" button to test the connection between PC and EVK board.

image::remotedevice.png[pdfwidth=100%]

=== Configure the project

*Build & Run*

After done above settings, the projects "Build & Run" configurations would be automatically generated. You can see in the "Run" the default deploy way is using the SFTP to upload image files which mentioned above why we need openssh-sftp-server installed into rootfs. One thing to update is the "Arguments" in the "Run settings", the "-platform wayland" should be added, as we use wayland for Qt's backend.

Build settings:

image::buildsetting.png[pdfwidth=100%]

Run settings:

image::run.png[pdfwidth=100%]

*.pro for build*

Modify the [project].pro file:

Change the pathto the target application location you want to download to the board.
Add three INCLUDEPATH env for target cross compile headers
Add macro defines for VFP and GL usage

----
...
target.path = /home/root/temp
INSTALLS += target
...
INCLUDEPATH +=  ~/opt/sysroots/aarch64-poky-linux/usr/include/c++/6.2.0/
INCLUDEPATH += ~/opt/sysroots/aarch64-poky-linux/usr/include/c++/6.2.0/aarch64-poky-linux/
INCLUDEPATH += ~/sysroots/aarch64-poky-linux/usr/include/
DEFINES += __ARM_PCS_VFP QT_NO_OPENGL
----

*Debug the app on the remote device*

After the app has been deployed to the board, we can use gdbserver to debug our app.

We assume that the IP of remote device is 10.193.102.81, the server port is 1234 and the IP of PC is 10.193.102.108.

Firstly we run the app on the board by gdbserver:

----
$ gdbserver 10.193.102.108:1234 gdbtestapp
----

Then open debug->start debugging->start and attach to remote application and change the server port to 1234.

Everythings is done here, now you can build, run and debug your QT applications on the i.MX8QXP EVK board.

=== Changes for 32 bits (e.g. i.MX7ULP)

In case the project is being built for a 32-bits SoC like i.MX7ULP, The following change on qmake.conf must e done.

#

#

MAKEFILE_GENERATOR = UNIX
CONFIG += incremental
QMAKE_INCREMENTAL_STYLE = sublib

include(../common/g++-unix.conf)

# modifications to g++.conf

QMAKE_CXX = arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-g++
QMAKE_LINK = arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-g++
QMAKE_LINK_SHLIB = arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-g++

QMAKE_LFLAGS += --sysroot=/opt/fsl-imx-xwayland/4.14-sumo-7ul-qtsdk/sysroots/cortexa7hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=neon-vfpv4
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=neon-vfpv4
